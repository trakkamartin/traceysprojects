## Landscape: 

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

InsurTech 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

McKinsey identifies the following 5 trends as having a pronouced impact on insurance: 
1. Applied AI
2. Distributed infratructure
3. Future of connectivity
4. Next-level automation
5. Trust architecture 

Stating, These technology trends have the potential to materially change some of the underlying inputs of insurance products and core functions. In underwriting, for example, automated warehouses (enabled via applied AI and distributed infrastructure) may fundamentally alter the nature and focus of workers’ compensation coverage by removing the majority of human workers from most warehouse operations.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Given that most of the insurtech companies in Australia are enablers of other insurers, their metrics are largely focused on sales/deals with other insurers to measure their success (Source: https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/au/news/technology/australia-insurtech-companies--the-leaders-in-2021-313538.aspx) 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

The busines idea requires a white label solutin, which open insurance can offer. It cannot be one of their off-the-shelf solutions due to the new interface and difference interaces with agritech companies. There will also be various underwriters having to collaborate. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

- Significant data retrieval will be required using python. 
- Machine learning to enable a superior underwriting process, not requiring hands on time consuming underwriting. 
- Blockchain to ensure accountability in the underwriting and sales process, governance, transparency and efficiency. 
- Mobile and only sales with APIs for each of the fintechs. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

My proposal is an insurance product. The product requires agtech to plug into an insurer API to gather the risk data and calculate the underwriting outcomes. The process needs to be automated and fast to enable point of sale of the insurance product when fintech products are sole and to have some machine learning so that there is not a lengthy underwriting process.
