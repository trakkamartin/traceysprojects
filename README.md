McKinsey identifies the following 5 trends as having a pronouced impact on insurance: 
1. Applied AI
2. Distributed infratructure
3. Future of connectivity
4. Next-level automation
5. Trust architecture 

Stating, These technology trends have the potential to materially change some of the underlying inputs of insurance products and core functions. In underwriting, for example, automated warehouses (enabled via applied AI and distributed infrastructure) may fundamentally alter the nature and focus of workers’ compensation coverage by removing the majority of human workers from most warehouse operations.
